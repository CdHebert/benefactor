## Description

Benefactor is a gift giving registry designed to make gift buying fun. Benefactor includes an element of surprise which allows the user to gift randomly to others.

Benefactor utilizes a user login and password to allow for customization of privacy levels, creation, editing and deletion of user populated lists and access to others users lists.
